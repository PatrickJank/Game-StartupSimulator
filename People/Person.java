package People;

/*
current design is to limit a number of available workers. A compromise is to have:
3 programmers MAX
1 internal testers (if I have time I might add external qa)
1 marketing dude looking for potential contracts.
In addition,
3 clients,
(i think? 3 clients would also be good, so for example all hard contracts come from Mr Hard or something)

3 subcontractors


that gives 11 people in total.
