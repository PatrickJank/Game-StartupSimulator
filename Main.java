/*
This is a mess. When I started making this game, God and I knew how it worked.
Now only God knows, so here is how many hours I wasted trying to figure out stuff:
- Why returns are not displaying any value (I didn't use any prints, so it had no way of DISPLAYING what it returns)  ~3 hours
- How to create setters and getters for project class, without doing them one by one (I ended up doing them one by one) - ~2 hours
- creating a generator for the Godforsaken projects: ~3 days
- setting up dates, and a way to change time - too many days to admit.
- Work on projects, fix bugs, test stuff - 2 days
